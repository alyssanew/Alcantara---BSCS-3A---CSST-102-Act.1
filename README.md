Lab Activity 1: Overview of Machine Learning Applications

# Machine Learning
 - Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

- In various domains, there are multiple applications of Machine Learning. We might not know that we use it everyday, and been part of our everyday life. Below are some of the examples of applications of Machine learning in different sectors.

# Agriculture
- Humans have a basic need for food, which farming currently provides. In agriculture, machine learning has the potential to transform one of the most important economic sectors and improve the way food is delivered to our tables.

*Applications* 
1. **Crop Monitoring and Yield Prediction**
    Utilizing ML models to monitor crop health and predict yields by analyzing data from various sources like satellite imagery, sensors, and weather data.
   
*Applications:*
 - **Disease and Pest Detection**: Early identification of crop diseases and pest infestations to implement timely interventions.
 - **Optimal Resource Usage**: Advising on efficient use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides based on predictive analytics.
 - **Yield Forecasting**: Estimating crop yields to assist farmers in planning and market strategy development.

# Healthcare
- These days, many health breakthroughs, such as the creation of innovative medical procedures, the management of patient data, and the treatment of chronic diseases, heavily rely on machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence.
