Lab Activity 1: Overview of Machine Learning Applications

# Machine Learning
 - Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

- In various domains, there are multiple applications of Machine Learning. We might not know that we use it everyday, and been part of our everyday life. Below are some of the examples of applications of Machine learning in different sectors.

# Agriculture
- Humans have a basic need for food, which farming currently provides. In agriculture, machine learning has the potential to transform one of the most important economic sectors and improve the way food is delivered to our tables.
